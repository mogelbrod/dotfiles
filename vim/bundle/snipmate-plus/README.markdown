# Why this #
This my fork of msanders/snipmate.vim, which is inactive from Apr 07, 2010. I
add the nested snippet expansion that I badly need in writing html and xml. I
also add more snippets I used and try to merge the pull request of
msanders/snipmate.vim

# Quickly install with #
Install [Pathogen](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen#readme) if you haven't
already. Then install snipmate as a bundle:

    cd ~/.vim/bundle
    git clone git://github.com/acevery/snipmate-plus.git
